# Ultrasonics Group Project
A place to organize project code, files, relevant papers, etc. Please remember to add any articles that you refer to in Overleaf using the \cite{} command, and be sure to add the corresponding \bibitem{}.
 
## Memo and report
in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rryhckcywhks)

## Presentation
also in Overleaf--will create this in early May
